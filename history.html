            aviation such as kites and
            attempts at tower jumping to supersonic and hypersonic flight by powered, heavier-than-air jets.

            Kite flying in China dates back to several hundred years BC and slowly spread around the world. It
            is
            thought to be the
            earliest example of man-made flight. Leonardo da Vinci's 15th-century dream of flight found
            expression in
            several
            rational designs, but which relied on poor science. <br>

            In the late 18th century the Montgolfier brothers invented the hot-air balloon and began manned
            flights. At
            almost the
            same time, the discovery of hydrogen gas led to the invention of the hydrogen balloon.[1] Various
            theories
            in mechanics
            by physicists during the same period of time, notably fluid dynamics and Newton's laws of motion,
            led to the
            foundation
            of modern aerodynamics, most notably by Sir George Cayley. Balloons, both free-flying and tethered,
            began to
            be used for
            military purposes from the end of the 18th century, with the French government establishing Balloon
            Companies during the
            French Revolution.[2] <br>

            Experiments with gliders provided the groundwork for learning the dynamics of heavier-than-air
            craft, most
            notably by
            Cayley, Otto Lilienthal, and Octave Chanute. By the early 20th century, advances in engine
            technology and
            aerodynamics
            made controlled, powered flight possible for the first time. In 1903, following their pioneering
            research
            and
            experiments with wing design and aircraft control, the Wright brothers successfully incorporated all
            of the
            required
            elements to create and fly the first aeroplane. The basic configuration with its characteristic tail
            was
            established by
            1909, followed by rapid design and performance improvements aided by the development of more
            powerful
            engines.

            The first great ships of the air were the rigid dirigible balloons pioneered by Ferdinand von
            Zeppelin,
            which soon
            became synonymous with airships and dominated long-distance flight until the 1930s, when large
            flying boats
            became
            popular. After World War II, the flying boats were in their turn replaced by land planes, and the
            new and
            immensely
            powerful jet engine revolutionised both air travel and military aviation.

            In the latter part of the 20th century, the advent of digital electronics produced great advances in
            flight
            instrumentation and "fly-by-wire" systems. The 21st century saw the large-scale use of pilotless
            drones for
            military,
            civilian and leisure use. With digital controls, inherently unstable aircraft such as flying wings
            became
            possible.</p><br>

        <b> The dream of flying is as old as mankind itself. However, the concept of the airplane has only been
            around
            for two
            centuries. Before that time, men and women tried to navigate the air by imitating the birds. They built
            wings to
            strap
            onto their arm or machines with flapping wings called ornithopters. On the surface, it seemed like a
            good
            plan.
            After
            all, there are plenty of birds in the air to show that the concept does work.

            The trouble is, it works better at bird-scale than it does at the much larger scale needed to lift both
            a
            man and a
            machine off the ground. So folks began to look for other ways to fly. Beginning in 1783, a few aeronauts
            made
            daring,
            uncontrolled flights in lighter-than-air balloons, filled with either hot air or hydrogen gas. But this
            was
            hardly a
            practical way to fly. There was no way to get from here to there unless the wind was blowing in the
            desired
            direction.

            It wasn’t until the turn of the nineteenth century that an English baronet from the gloomy moors of
            Yorkshire
            conceived
            a flying machine with fixed wings, a propulsion system, and movable control surfaces. This was the
            fundamental
            concept
            of the airplane. Sir George Cayley also built the first true airplane — a kite mounted on a stick with a
            movable
            tail.
            It was crude, but it proved his idea worked, and from that first humble glider evolved the amazing
            machines
            that
            have
            taken us to the edge of space at speeds faster than sound.

            This wing of the museum focuses on the early history of the airplane, from its conception in 1799 to the
            years just
            before World War I. Because we are a museum of pioneer aviation, we don’t spend a great deal of time on
            those years
            after Orville Wright closed the doors of the Wright Company in 1916. We concentrate on the development
            of
            the
            airplane
            before it was commonplace, when flying machines were odd contraptions of stick, cloth, and wire; engines
            were
            temperamental and untrustworthy; and pilots were never quite sure whether they’d be able to coax their
            machine into
            the
            air or bring it down in one piece. </b>

        <H3>World War 1 and 2</H3>
        <p><br>
            World War II witnessed tremendous growth in the size of American military aviation, from about 2,500
            airplanes to
            nearly
            300,000 by the war’s end. The Museum’s collection of 30 World War II-era American military aircraft ranges
            from
            propeller-driven trainers, fighters, flying boats, and bombers to the nation’s first generation of
            jet-powered
            fighters
            to take to the air. They represent the pilots of the Army Air Forces, Navy, and Marines, as well as the
            crews who
            flew
            them, the support personnel on the ground and at sea who maintained them, and the people who made these
            weapons of
            war
            on the home front. The legacy of their contribution to World War II and the continued enthusiasm for these
            aircraft
            still resonates with Americans today.
