    <h1>Soccer/Football</h1>
    <h3>"The world's most watched and prized sport from all countries". It traces back more than 2000 years ago
        in
        ancient China. Soccer is a fast paced, strategy game played by men, women, and kids. Its professional leagues
        have gained millions of
        fans around the world. "</h3>
    <h3> History:</h3>
    <em>A gift to mankind and uniquely different to other sports from all around the globe. Professional soccer has been
        around in England since the 1800s, but some say the game was created 2000 years ago by the
        Aztecs using a rubber ball. Others say a version of the game was played in China as far back as the 3rd century
        BC. The
        fact is, we'll never know when, or on what continent, soccer was invented. The first known examples of a team
        game involving a ball, which was made out of a rock, occurred in old Mesoamerican
        cultures for over 3,000 years ago. It was by the Aztecs called Tchatali, although various versions of the game
        were
        spread over large regions. In some ritual occasions, the ball would symbolize the sun and the captain of the
        losing team
        would be sacrificed to the gods. A unique feature of the Mesoamerican ball game versions was a bouncing ball
        made of
        rubber – no other early culture had access to rubber.</em>

    <h3>An Insight:</h3>
    <em>Many people play soccer and it is in the heart of all people. The basics is kicking a ball around to
        the other
        goal. A total of 3.5 billion peopl watch the game and are fascinated by it. It has produced world-class players
        in the making. Players primarily are in team of 11 primarily using their feet in a rectangular field called a
        pitch. The game of association football is played in accordance with the Laws of the Game, a set of rules that
        has been in
        effect since 1863 and maintained by the IFAB since 1886. The game is played with a football that is 68–70 cm
        (27 to 28 in)
        in circumference. The two teams compete to get the ball into the other team's goal (between the posts, under the
        bar,
        and across the goal line), thereby scoring a goal. When the ball is in play, the players mainly use their feet,
        but may
        use any other part of their body, except for their hands or arms, to control, strike, or pass the ball. Only the
        goalkeepers may use their hands and arms, and only then within the penalty area. The team that has scored more
        goals at
        the end of the game is the winner. There are situations where a goal can be disallowed, such as an offside call
        or a
        foul in the build-up to the goal. Depending on the format of the competition, an equal number of goals scored
        may result
        in a draw being declared, or the game goes into extra time or a penalty shoot-out.[5]</em>
