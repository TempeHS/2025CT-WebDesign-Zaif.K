        <b>History:<b>
                <p>The history of aviation extends for more than two thousand years, from the earliest forms of
                    aviation such as kites and
                    attempts at tower jumping to supersonic and hypersonic flight by powered, heavier-than-air jets.

                    Kite flying in China dates back to several hundred years BC and slowly spread around the world. It
                    is
                    thought to be the
                    earliest example of man-made flight. Leonardo da Vinci's 15th-century dream of flight found
                    expression in
                    several
                    rational designs, but which relied on poor science.

                    In the late 18th century the Montgolfier brothers invented the hot-air balloon and began manned
                    flights. At
                    almost the
                    same time, the discovery of hydrogen gas led to the invention of the hydrogen balloon.[1] Various
                    theories
                    in mechanics
                    by physicists during the same period of time, notably fluid dynamics and Newton's laws of motion,
                    led to the
                    foundation
                    of modern aerodynamics, most notably by Sir George Cayley. Balloons, both free-flying and tethered,
                    began to
                    be used for
                    military purposes from the end of the 18th century, with the French government establishing Balloon
                    Companies during the
                    French Revolution.[2]

                    Experiments with gliders provided the groundwork for learning the dynamics of heavier-than-air
                    craft, most
                    notably by
                    Cayley, Otto Lilienthal, and Octave Chanute. By the early 20th century, advances in engine
                    technology and
                    aerodynamics
                    made controlled, powered flight possible for the first time. In 1903, following their pioneering
                    research
                    and
                    experiments with wing design and aircraft control, the Wright brothers successfully incorporated all
                    of the
                    required
                    elements to create and fly the first aeroplane. The basic configuration with its characteristic tail
                    was
                    established by
                    1909, followed by rapid design and performance improvements aided by the development of more
                    powerful
                    engines.

                    The first great ships of the air were the rigid dirigible balloons pioneered by Ferdinand von
                    Zeppelin,
                    which soon
                    became synonymous with airships and dominated long-distance flight until the 1930s, when large
                    flying boats
                    became
                    popular. After World War II, the flying boats were in their turn replaced by land planes, and the
                    new and
                    immensely
                    powerful jet engine revolutionised both air travel and military aviation.

                    In the latter part of the 20th century, the advent of digital electronics produced great advances in
                    flight
                    instrumentation and "fly-by-wire" systems. The 21st century saw the large-scale use of pilotless
                    drones for
                    military,
                    civilian and leisure use. With digital controls, inherently unstable aircraft such as flying wings
                    became
                    possible.</p>
