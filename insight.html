        <b> How do planes fly?:</b>
        There are four forces which are necessary for flight. These are lift, thrust, drag, and weight. These forces
        must be
        balanced to keep the plane in the air.

        You don’t need an engine to fly, as birds, paper planes, and gliders show us. In a plane, the engine doesn’t
        move the
        plane upward, it just moves it forward. The wings move it forward.

        For a plane to fly, the engines provide thrust which moves it forward through the air. As it moves, air flows
        rapidly
        over the wings. This creates a force called lift which keeps the plane in the air despite it being so heavy.

        Air moves more quickly over the top of the wing, creating an area of low pressure. Underneath the wing, air
        moves
        slowly, creating high pressure which lifts the wing upwards. This is known as Bernoulli’s Principle.

        Thrust comes from the engine and opposes drag, which is caused by air resistance. Lift comes from the change in
        pressure
        over the wing and opposes weight, which is caused by mass and gravity.

        It might sound quite complicated, but luckily pilots know what they are doing!

            <B>What is the Environmental impact of flying?:</B>
            Everything that we do has an environmental impact. This means that they can contribute to climate change,
            which
            is the
            way that our behaviour has an effect on the overall climate. This is sometimes called a carbon footprint.

            Obviously, however, some things have a bigger impact than others.

            You probably already know that flying isn’t very good for the environment. Planes release a lot of carbon
            dioxide as a
            waste product from fuel. The aviation industry accounts for around 5% of global warming emissions, according
            to
            the BBC.
            That doesn’t sound like a lot, but consider that most people don’t fly very often and some people have never
            been on a
            plane in their whole life.

            Illustration of the earth with a fever and a thermometer sticking out of its mouth.

            You can reduce your carbon footprint by making some easy lifestyle changes. You could go on holiday in the
            UK
            instead of
            flying abroad. An easy change is to try walking or using public transport rather going in a car. You can
            also
            check the
            food miles on your groceries to make sure that they haven’t been flown from somewhere far away to get to
            you.
            Another
            good thing to do is to reduce the amount of plastic that you use and to recycle where possible.

                <b> AERONATICS:</b>
                Aeronautics is the study of the science of flight. Aeronautics is the method of designing an airplane or
                other
                flying
                machine. There are four basic areas that aeronautical engineers must understand in order to be able to
                design
                planes.

                Aeronautics is the science or art involved with the study, design, and manufacturing of air
                flight-capable
                machines, and
                the techniques of operating aircraft and rockets within the atmosphere. The British Royal Aeronautical
                Society
                identifies the aspects of "aeronautical Art, Science and Engineering" and "The profession of Aeronautics
                (which
                expression includes Astronautics)."[1]

                While the term originally referred solely to operating the aircraft, it has since been expanded to
                include
                technology,
                business, and other aspects related to aircraft.[2] The term "aviation" is sometimes used
                interchangeably
                with
                aeronautics, although "aeronautics" includes lighter-than-air craft such as airships, and includes
                ballistic
                vehicles
                while "aviation" technically does not.[2]

                A significant part of aeronautical science is a branch of dynamics called aerodynamics, which deals with
                the
                motion of
                air and the way that it interacts with objects in motion, such as an aircraft.

                        Our rules for both private and commercial flying are there to keep you safe – but the standards
                        are
                        different.
                        Airlines
                        and other commercial .
                        viation safety isn't just the FAA, the pilot's or the flight attendants’ job — it takes all of
                        us.
                        We
                        all need
                        to
                        think
                        about safety — even just for a minute.

                        Here are some tips to follow to keep you and your fellow travelers safe when you fly. Most
                        importantly,
                        pay
                        attention to
                        your flight and cabin crews. They are there to keep you as safe as possible.

                        You can make your flight even safer by following these guidelines:

                        -Pay attention to the flight attendant safety briefing at the beginning of your flight and read
                        the
                        safety
                        briefing
                        card.
                        -Buckle up. Keep you and your family safe by wearing a seat belt at all times while seated.
                        -Seat belts on airplanes restrain and help keep you safe while you're seated during critical
                        phases
                        of
                        flight
                        and
                        during
                        turbulence. The seat belt is intended to be worn low and tight on the hips, not the abdomen, to
                        prevent
                        injuries
                        and
                        effectively limit the body’s forward motion.
                        -Use an approved child safety seat or device if your child weighs less than 40 pounds.
                        -Prevent in-flight injuries by following your airline's carry-on restrictions.
                        -Check your airline's Portable Electronic Device (PED) policy.
